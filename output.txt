I have added detailed error logging (`traceback.print_exc()`) to the `create_order` function in `backend/routes/order.py`.
Please restart your browser (if necessary) and try to proceed to checkout again at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.
When the "An error occurred during checkout" message appears, please **copy the entire traceback that is printed in the server console** and provide it to me. This will give us the specific error details needed to fix the issue.

Waiting for the user to provide the traceback.



To Run application first activate virtual environment :
D:\Projects\samarth_aushadhalay\.venv\Scripts\activate
Then : python app.py


OR Alternative: You can also run it directly using the virtual environment's Python executable:
D:\Projects\samarth_aushadhalay\.venv\Scripts\python.exe app.py
